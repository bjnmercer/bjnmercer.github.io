Yes that's right, I've started a blog.

Now with the self referencing first blog post out of the way, lets go over the goals of this spiffy looking blog:
1. it won't be a spiffy looking blog (I am terrible at CSS)
2. it shall detail my various projects which I have yet to upload (this _is_ a test blog post after all)
3. it _may_ be informative to people with an interest in programming (particularly the ML family of Functional Programming)

I'm fond of F#, so if that's your thing, hit the subscribe button, and I won't see you on the next post. (Note 1: I don't think the RSS thing works)

OK, let's try some F# code:

```fsharp
let test = "Blah"
failwith "Useless example"
```

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

```ocaml
let test = "Blah"
failwith "Useless example"
```

Update 1: Well it appears F# isn't a supported language for the syntax highlighter. Pretty annoying, considering brainfuck, MS-DOS batch files and _even_ MATLAB are supported.

Update 2:

(Note 2: Precisely _none_ of you will realise I've lifted this text pretty much straight from my other automotive website "Project Crown". Don't bother googling, you won't find it.)
