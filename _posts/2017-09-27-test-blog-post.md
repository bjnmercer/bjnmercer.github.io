Yes that's right, I've started a blog.

Now with the self referencing first blog post out of the way, lets go over the goals of this blog:
1. it won't be a spiffy looking blog (I am terrible at CSS)
2. it _may_ be informative to people with an interest in programming (particularly the ML family of Functional Programming)

I'm fond of F#, so if that's not your thing, don't hit the subscribe button, and I won't see you next time. (Note 1: I don't think the RSS thing works anyway)

```F#
let test = "Blah"
failwith "Useless example"
```

(Note 2: Precisely _none_ of you will realise I've lifted this text pretty much straight from my other automotive website "Project Crown". Don't bother googling, you won't find it.)
