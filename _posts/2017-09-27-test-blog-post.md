~~Hi, Pete Smith here. Have you ever woken up in the middle of the night and thought: "I gotta learn programming"

Well, have we got a deal for you!~~

Yes that's right, I've started a ~~blog~~ news site.

Now with the self referencing first blog post out of the way, lets go over the goals of this ~~blog~~ news site:
1. it won't be a spiffy news site (I am terrible at CSS)
2. it _may_ be informative to people with an interest in programming (particularly the ML family of Functional Programming)

I'm fond of F#, so if that's not your thing, don't hit the subscribe button, and I won't see you next time. (Note 1: I don't think the RSS thing works anyway)

```fsharp
let test = "Blah"
failwith "Useless example"
```

(Note 2: Precisely _none_ of you will realise I've lifted this text pretty much straight from my other automotive website "Project Crown". Don't bother googling, you won't find it.)
